# 🚀 Blood Bond – My First Full-Stack Project!

Blood Bond is a **voluntary blood donation platform** built as my **final year diploma project**. This is my first full-stack web application, and it’s been an exciting and challenging journey that taught me a lot about backend development, UI design, debugging, and full-stack integration.

I also integrated a **Botpress chatbot** to assist users in navigating the platform!
